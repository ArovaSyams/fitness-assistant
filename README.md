This is your RAG application for fitness assistace

## Project overview

The Fitness Assistant is a RAG application designed to assist
users with their fitness routines.

The main use cases include:

1. Exercise Selection: Recommending exercises based on the type
of activity, targeted muscle groups, or available equipment.
2. Exercise Replacement: Replacing an exercise with suitable
alternatives.
3. Exercise Instructions: Providing guidance on how to perform a
specific exercise.
4. Conversational Interaction: Making it easy to get information
without sifting through manuals or websites.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about
various exercises, including:

- **Exercise Name:** The name of the exercise (e.g., Push-Ups, Squats).
- **Type of Activity:** The general category of the exercise (e.g., Strength, Mobility, Cardio).
- **Type of Equipment:** The equipment needed for the exercise (e.g., Bodyweight, Dumbbells, Kettlebell).
- **Body Part:** The part of the body primarily targeted by the exercise (e.g., Upper Body, Core, Lower Body).
- **Type:** The movement type (e.g., Push, Pull, Hold, Stretch).
- **Muscle Groups Activated:** The specific muscles engaged during
the exercise (e.g., Pectorals, Triceps, Quadriceps).
- **Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance on how to perform the
exercise correctly.

The dataset was generated using ChatGPT and contains 207 records. It serves as the foundation for the Fitness Assistant's exercise recommendations and instructional support.

You can find the data in [`data/data.csv`](data/data.csv).

## Technologies

- Python 3.12
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- [Minsearch](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch) for full-text search
- Flask as the API interface (see [Background](#background) for more information on Flask)
- Grafana for monitoring and PostgreSQL as the backend for it
- OpenAI as an LLM

## Preparation

Since we use OpenAI, you need to provide the API key:

1. Install `direnv`. If you use Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install direnv` and then `direnv hook bash >> ~/.bashrc`.
2. Copy `.envrc_template` into `.envrc` and insert your key there.
3. For OpenAI, it's recommended to create a new project and use a separate key.
4. Run `direnv allow` to load the key into your environment.

For dependency management, we use pipenv, so you need to install it:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Once installed, you can install the app dependencies:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

## Evaluation


## Retrieval
the basic approach - using minsearch without any boosting - give the following metrics:  

hit_rate: 94.9%, 
MMR: 84%

The improved version (with better boosting)
hit_rate: 95%
MMR: 92.6%

The best boosting parameters
```python
boost = {
    'exercise_name': 2.8664358956968776,
